<H1> One of my favorite childhood games was minecraft. I love this game because your imagination is the limit. There are two 3 main modes which are creative, survival and multiplayer.</p1>

                    <h2>Creative</h2> 
                    <p1> In creative mode you can do what ever you want. You can get any item you want using commands or going into your inventory. You can fly as much or as long as you would like and you cant die. People generally play creative mode to have infinate building materials and build what ever they would like.
                         </p>
                    <h3>Surival</h3>
                         <p2>In surival mode you spawn in a randomly generated world and you must find resources to surive mobs. People play survival because its a challenge and if you die you lose what ever gear you had you either have to go back and find your loot or start over and make new gear. There are so many things to do in survival and the challenge makes it more fun in my opinion. </p2>
                    <h4>Multiplayer</h4>
                         <p3> Multiplayer is my favorite mode. You join servers other peoples pre build world and interact with tens of thousands of random players. Some servers revolve around mini games, others might revolve around survival. It all depends what the creator of the server had in mind.   </p3>
                        <h4>Want to know which platform minecraft is on? Its on every platform from xbox and ps4 to pc to even nintendo switch. </h4>
